**Patient Triage Card Studio** is a mobile application designed by **Signal Fathom, LLC** to help hospitals and healthcare organizations create, organize, and manage patient triage cards and exercise materials.

This page contains the **Terms and Conditions** for the use of the app. By downloading, installing, or using Patient Triage Card Studio, **and by logging into the App, you agree to follow and be bound by these Terms each time you log in.**

## Terms and Conditions

**Effective Date: December 09, 2025**

These Terms and Conditions (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of the mobile application **Patient Triage Card Studio** (the “**App**”), owned and operated by **Signal Fathom, LLC** (“**Signal Fathom**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”).

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, and by logging into the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms each time you log in. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not download, install, access, or use the App.

### 1. Relationship With Google Play

The App is distributed through **Google Play** (the “**Store**”). Your download, installation, and use of the App are also governed by the **Google Play Terms of Service**, **Google Play Developer Policies**, and any other terms or policies provided by Google (together, the “**Store Terms**”).

We also use **Google Play Billing** and **RevenueCat**, a third-party subscription management service, to help manage in-app purchases and keep subscription status in sync across devices. RevenueCat does **not** process your payment card directly; payments are processed by Google Play Billing.

* Where there is any conflict between these Terms and the Store Terms regarding purchases, billing, refunds, subscription management, or account handling, the **Store Terms control** your relationship with Google.
* Signal Fathom, LLC does **not** process payments directly inside the App. All billing, renewals, and refunds are handled by **Google Play Billing** in accordance with the Store Terms. RevenueCat is used only to interpret and synchronize your subscription status so that the correct features are unlocked inside the App.

---

### 2. Subscriptions, Pricing, and Billing

#### 2.1 Subscription Options

The App is offered on a **subscription basis** through **Google Play Billing**. We currently offer:

* A **1-month subscription** (“Monthly Subscription”); and
* A **12-month subscription** (“Annual Subscription”).

The specific prices and any applicable taxes or fees are displayed within Google Play at the time of purchase. We use **RevenueCat** to help manage subscriptions and entitlements based on the information we receive from Google Play Billing (for example, which product you purchased and whether your subscription is active).

#### 2.2 Auto-Renewal

Subject to Google Play’s capabilities and settings:

* Your subscription may **auto-renew** at the end of each billing period (monthly or yearly) unless you cancel your subscription through your **Google Play account** before the renewal date.
* Auto-renewal, billing dates, and cancellation timing are managed by **Google Play Billing**, not directly by Signal Fathom, LLC.
* Inside the App, we rely on data provided by Google Play Billing (and interpreted through RevenueCat) to determine whether your subscription is active and which features should be available.

#### 2.3 Price Changes

Signal Fathom, LLC **reserves the right to change pricing** for the Monthly Subscription or Annual Subscription at any time, including:

* Changing the **monthly price** for future billing periods; and
* Changing the **annual price** for future renewal periods.

Any price changes will be communicated and applied in accordance with Google Play policies and processes. Price changes will generally apply **only to future billing periods** and will not retroactively affect a period you have already paid for.

#### 2.4 No Long-Term Contracts

There are **no long-term contracts** beyond each chosen subscription period:

* You may cancel your subscription at any time through your **Google Play account settings**, subject to Google Play’s rules for cancellation timing and access.
* Canceling a subscription stops future renewals but does not generally provide a refund for the current period, unless allowed by Google Play’s policies.
* **Uninstalling the App or deleting your in-App account does not cancel your Google Play subscription.** To stop future charges, you must manage or cancel your subscription directly in Google Play under **Payments & Subscriptions**.

#### 2.5 Refunds

Refunds for purchases and subscriptions related to the App are governed by **Google Play’s refund policies**, not by Signal Fathom, LLC directly.

* As a general policy, **Signal Fathom, LLC does not offer direct refunds**.
* Any refunds, if available, are processed **solely through Google Play** in accordance with their rules and procedures.
* **RevenueCat does not control refunds**; it only helps us understand your current subscription status based on information from Google Play Billing.
* You may request a refund through Google Play, particularly in situations such as:

  * The App is **not installable** or **cannot be used as intended** on your compatible device, despite meeting the Store’s stated requirements.

Signal Fathom, LLC cannot override or guarantee any refund decisions made by Google.

### 6. Clinical, Operational, and Training Use in Healthcare Settings

The App is designed for use by **medical and non-medical professionals in hospital and healthcare settings** as a tool to **support and implement existing protocols and clinical judgment**. It assists with organizing, documenting, and managing triage, exercises, and patient-management workflows, but it does **not replace** clinical judgment, hospital policies, or emergency response procedures.

The App does not itself provide medical diagnosis, prescribe treatment, or independently determine the appropriate standard of care.
